    <h1>  My Computer Science Journey </h1>
<section>
    <h2> The Start of Something Great </h2> 
    <p> Before going Community College, I had no coding experience. Although,
      I was passion about computers and technolgy. I would watch tech Youtubers everyday as soon I got home from school. I knew I wanted to get into coding and creating
       something, so I chose Computer Science. I had the opportunity to move in with my aunt and uncle
        in Santa Ana, California so I went to Santa Ana College. I spent about 3 years at Santa Ana College.
        I transfered from Santa Ana College with my AS in Computer Science to California State Univeristy, Fullerton.
