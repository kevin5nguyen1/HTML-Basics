    <p> Hello! My name is Kevin Nguyen. I transfered from Santa Ana College with my AS in Computer Science and am pursing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
     I am 22 years old. Orginally from Washington, about an hour North of Seattle, I lived there for my whole life and moved to Santa Ana in 2016 after finishing highschool.
    California is totally different from where I am from. In Washington, it was always cold and raining for about 10 months out of the year. The warmest it gets in
       in the summer is roughly 90 degrees but it is extremely rare. It also snows in the winter as well. California is a nice change for my girlfriendand I. We love going out
        and enjoying nature and the warm weather will our dog. On weekends, my girlfriend and I like to take our dog hiking or the beach. </p>
